# What I am most proud of


# Proposal
My Idea for this assignemnt is to create a game world in which you start off with a car.
This car will follow a procedurally generated road. 

This road will be loaded into pieces such as:
* Straight Piece
* A left Turn
* A Right Turn
* A T junction 
* A Crossroads

At the T junction and the Crossroads the car will choose a direction to proceed,
unless a player takes control of the car. The car will be controlled using colliders 
and triggers. The car will turn using the lerp and slerp functions. 


Along the roads different sized buildings
will be placed  along the roads. These buildings consist of premade prefabs and the 
engine will randomly generate the buildings in what ever order it wants.


If I also have enough time I would like to try and create a day and night cycle where
The car and buildings may look different in edition to having streetlights and the 
carlights turned on during night time.
